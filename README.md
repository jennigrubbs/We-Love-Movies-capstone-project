This project was created by Jenni Grubbs, a student at Thinkful in the flex software engineering program.

The goal of this project is to create a backend for WeLoveMovies, a startup. It contains the database and builds out specific routes so that WeLoveMovies' app users can gain access to data about movies, theaters, and reviews.
